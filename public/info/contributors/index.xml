Karoline has worked extensively on microbiomes from all over the planet and has developed several methods for microbiome analysis. Her lab analyses microbiome data across several levels of complexity, ranging from world-wide ocean communities to highly controlled communities in laboratory fermentors. Her ultimate goal is to build models of microbial communities that can be used to manipulate these communities.</description></item><item><title>Sam Röttjers</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/info/contributors/sam_rottjers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:50:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/info/contributors/sam_rottjers/</guid><description>Sam Röttjers is a PhD student of Karoline and works on method development for noisy networks. Sam focuses on the top-down side of microbiome research and has worked with data from arthropod endosymbionts, the human gut and ocean time series. His main goal is to translate concepts from theoretical ecology and network theory to association networks in a way that deals with the inherently low accuracy of these networks.
