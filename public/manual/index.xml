Importing a class or function from mako therefore can be done as follows:
from mako.scripts.base import BaseDriver
from mako.scripts.neo4biom import Biom2Neo
from mako.scripts.io import IoDriver
from mako.scripts.netstats import NetstatsDriver
from mako.scripts.metastats import MetastatsDriver
from mako.scripts.utils import ParentDriver
For learning more about the parameters used by a driver, type help(driver), replacing driver with the name of the driver you are interested in.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/introduction/intro/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:32:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/introduction/intro/</guid><description>The database schema used by mako defines a set structure for uploading microbiome-related files to a Neo4j database. The software tool is based around this data schema and provides an application programming interface (API), command line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI) for converting files to the database, or for extracting relevant files and exporting these as a text file or to Cytoscape.
In this manual, we will briefly discuss mako&amp;rsquo;s CLI, GUI and API.</description></item><item><title>CLI Overview</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/cli/overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:52:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/cli/overview/</guid><description>The CLI has been separated in several modules for ease of use. Selecting a module is done by including the module name in the script call, like so:
mako base
mako neo4biom
mako io
mako netstats
mako metastats
mako manta
mako anuran
For learning more about the parameters used by each module, type mako module -h in your terminal, replacing module with the name of the module you are interested in.</description></item><item><title>Using a driver class</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/api/drivers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:36:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/api/drivers/</guid><description>While mako&amp;rsquo;s functions can be called from command line, they have also been documented extensively so they can be used from a Python script. The base, neo4biom, io, netstats, metastats and utils modules each contain a class that can interact with a running Neo4j database instance. To carry out the functions as part of a script, simply instantiate an object with the necessary information to connect to the database and it will set up a Neo4j driver that can be used to run mako-specific functions or to run custom queries.</description></item><item><title>mako base</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/cli/base/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:33:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/cli/base/</guid><description>The base module can start a Neo4j Desktop if no Neo4j Desktop process has been started already, or safely shut down Neo4j Desktop if the process has been stored and the process ID is available in the config file. Additionally, the module can clear the database or check constraints.
If connecting to a Docker instance or other running instance of Neo4j, only the -clear and -check functions of the base module are relevant.</description></item><item><title>mako neo4biom</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/cli/neo4biom/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:33:36 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/cli/neo4biom/</guid><description>The neo4biom module can be used to write BIOM files or tab-delimited files to a Neo4j database according to mako&amp;rsquo;s database schema. The -fp prefix contains the shared file path, so there is no need to write the full file path, partial file paths or just filenames are sufficient if -fp is used. If the -o flag is provided, BIOM files are uploaded without counts (so only taxonomy and metadata is uploaded).</description></item><item><title>mako io</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/cli/io/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:33:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/cli/io/</guid><description>The io module can be used to write network files to a Neo4j database according to mako&amp;rsquo;s database schema. The -fp prefix contains the shared file path, so there is no need to write the full file path, partial file paths or just filenames are sufficient if -fp is used.
The io module also has options for adding extra metadata to the Neo4j database. If a tab-delimited edge list is supplied with existing nodes in the 1st column and new properties in the 2nd column, this is used to create a new Property node with relationships containing property values.</description></item><item><title>GUI Overview</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/gui/overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:35:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/gui/overview/</guid><description>The GUI provides a graphical interface for most of the functionality of the CLI. There are two ways to run the GUI: you can download and run the executable, or you can run the GUI script. You can download the executables from the mako releases page. Releases that come with updated executables, have them listed in the release description.
Alternatively, you can run the main_GUI.py script from a Python IDE. Simply download the mako git repository, install all dependencies and use your IDE to start main_GUI.</description></item><item><title>mako netstats</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/cli/netstats/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:33:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/cli/netstats/</guid><description>The netstats module can be used to carry out set operations on networks in the Neo4j database, leading to creation of Set nodes that contain the intersections, unions or differences across (groups of) networks. If no networks are specified, operations are carried out across all networks.
By default, intersections only include edges with identical weights; so for an edge to be detected as present in 3 networks, it needs to have the same weight across all 3 networks.</description></item><item><title>mako metastats</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/cli/metastats/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 11:34:02 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/manual/cli/metastats/</guid><description>The metastats module can carry out some basic operations on metadata. It can agglomerate networks to higher taxonomic levels (so all edges are merged to Family-level associations, for example), or it can carry out basic statistics. Specifically, it can calculate Spearman correlations between taxon abundances and quantitative metadata, and hypergeometric tests for qualitative metadata.
The edge agglomeration works by finding patterns, e.g. genus&amp;ndash;taxon&amp;ndash;edge&amp;ndash;taxon&amp;ndash;genus. If two edges have the same genus at both sides and matching weight, they can be merged together.</description></item></channel></rss>
