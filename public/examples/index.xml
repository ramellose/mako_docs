The case studies below have been selected to demonstrate the simplicity and speed with which mako is able to process microbiome data. In brief, the case studies address the following topics:
Rapid meta-analysis of multiple sponge-specific networks
Creating and querying hierarchical metabolic data
Validating an association network using microbe-metabolite interactions mined from literature
Working with a curated data set containing 60 unique studies
Querying 3- and 4-node cliques
Identifying associations linked to a metabolic pathway</description></item><item><title>HMA-LMA status</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/sponges/intro/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 May 2021 10:47:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/sponges/intro/</guid><description>Marine sponges, also known as Porifera, are a highly diverse clade of animals known for their ability to host complex microbial communities. Generally, these sponges can be categorized as either high microbial abundance (HMA) or low microbial abundance (LMA), depending on the density of the microbial communities they harbour (Gloeckner et al., 2014). Relatively little is known about these communities, since most members are uncultivated.
In this case study, we are going to integrate association networks derived from different sponge orders with a list of taxa previously found to be related to the HMA-LMA dichotomy.</description></item><item><title>A literature-curated network</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/metalit/intro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 09:38:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/metalit/intro/</guid><description>Many interactions between microbes are mediated through metabolites. Microbes can secrete metabolites like lactate, which can then be used by others as a carbon source. However, with only metabarcoding data, it is impossible to see metabolite fluxes or expression of genes that are required to facilitate such fluxes.
In this case study, we are going to import a literature-curated network of metabolite-driven microbial interactions. We will use this network to find associations in a different association network that could possibly be driven by specific metabolic interactions.</description></item><item><title>Inflammatory bowel disease</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/ibd/intro/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 May 2021 09:37:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/ibd/intro/</guid><description>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses multiple chronic inflammatory conditions that affect the gastrointestinal tract. Although the prevalence of this disease is increasing worldwide, it occurs most frequently in North America and Europe, with approximately 0.3% of the European population being affected (Burisch et al., 2013). Over the past decade, the gut microbiome has been found to be implicated in disease etiology (Huttenhower et al., 2014). Yet, the numerous factors that appear to play a role in IBD make this disease challenging to study.</description></item><item><title>Short chain fatty acids</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/propionate/intro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 13:44:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/propionate/intro/</guid><description>The human gut microbiome is capable of fermenting carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids, which have been linked to human health. One of those short-chain fatty acids is propionate. In their review on propionate production, Louis and Flint (2017) provide a brief overview of the bacterial species that have the metabolic capacity to contribute to propionate formation. Not all bacteria are able to degrade all substrates, or to carry out the entire pathway.</description></item><item><title>Network motifs</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/motifs/intro/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Apr 2021 13:38:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/motifs/intro/</guid><description>Network motifs are a type of recurring pattern or subgraph that can be found in larger networks. In transcription networks, some motifs lead to dynamics that are crucial for organism functionality (Alon, 2007). However, the motifs described by Alon are directed: they show whether gene A affects gene B, or the other way around. Consequently, not all insights from Alon&amp;rsquo;s and related work may translate to microbial association networks. Other methodological issues are also at play: edges in transcriptional networks are much more likely to reflect actual interactions compared to edges in association networks, since many are inferred from experimental work or can be verified that way.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/qiita/intro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Apr 2021 16:30:54 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/qiita/intro/</guid><description>For presenting mako, we constructed a curated database of 60 data sets and 60 networks which were collected from Qiita (Gonzalez et al., 2018). There are two ways to access this data: one is to load a databasume dump, the other is through Code Ocean. Both methods are explained here.
In addition to working with the Code Ocean code capsule directly, you can download files from the capsule and run the commands locally.</description></item><item><title>Sponge networks</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/sponges/setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 May 2021 10:49:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/sponges/setup/</guid><description>For this section of the case study, we will interact with a running Neo4j database. If you do not have such a database available, please take a look at the Neo4j section of this web page to learn how to set up one locally or via Docker.
To upload our data, we need to open a terminal and navigate to the folder where we stored the files from the previous section.</description></item><item><title>Association network</title><link>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/metalit/corrs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 09:39:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ramellose.github.io/mako_docs/examples/metalit/corrs/</guid><description>For the remainder of this case study, we will interact with a running Neo4j database.

Specifically, we need the following files: tab-delimited taxon abundance and lineage files, and an edge list that links microbes to metabolites. We will use the R package phyloseq to generate the first file and use Hmisc to generate the correlations.
In an R environment, let&amp;rsquo;s first load the necessary packages and files. Make sure your working directory is set to the location where you downloaded the files.</description></item></channel></rss>
