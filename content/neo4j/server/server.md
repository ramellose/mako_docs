For hosting a persistent Neo4j database that is accessible to multiple users and can be encrypted, it may be beneficial to host Neo4j on a server and configure it appropriately. Since the Community Edition only supports a single database however, this is less suitable for extensive server solutions. The <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/in-production/">Neo4j developer guides</a> contain additional documentation on Neo4j administration for production. Guides for deploying Neo4j in the cloud can also be found in the <a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-cloud-deployment/>cloud section of the operations manual</a>.
