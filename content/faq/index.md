  <summary>After installing via conda, the <code>mako -h</code> command does not work.</summary>
Please check if you installed mako from the correct source. During installation, the mako source should look similar to the image below.

You may need to configure your conda channel order in case the source is not similar to the source shown above. First try running conda config â€“add channels ramellose again: if this does not work, please see <a href="https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html">the conda instructions for managing channels</a>.

  <summary>I cannot find the username and password credentials for the Neo4j Browser.</summary>
Please check <a href="../neo4j/browser/browser">the Neo4j Browser page</a> for configurations used in the case studies presented on this website. If you are running Neo4j from Docker, the username and password are set using the NEO4J_AUTH part of the Docker command.

  <summary>The mako software raises a WebSocket Connection Failure error.</summary>
If you experience this error, you are likely using the wrong parameters for connecting to the Neo4j database. Please check <a href="../neo4j/browser/browser">the Neo4j Browser page</a> for an overview of alternative configurations of the database and supply the appropriate connection parameters to the mako software.

  <summary>Neo4j Browser states that database access is not available.</summary>
Like the error above, you are likely using the wrong parameters for connecting to the Neo4j database. Please check <a href="../neo4j/browser/browser">the Neo4j Browser page</a> for an overview of alternative configurations of the database.

<details>
  <summary>The mako software cannot import files.</summary>
Please check if this is due to a path error. If you are running mako outside the directory where your files are stored, you need to give a filepath with the <code>-fp</code> parameter. If you navigate to the directory where your files are, you can omit this parameter. Note that you either need to give a folder name or file names. You need to unzip zipped files into a folder before mako can use them. 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>The mako software did not work as expected.</summary>
The software should create a mako.log file in the directory from where it was run. You can open this file in Notepad to see a detailed error report that should describe what went wrong.
