Cypher is a query language specifically developed for property graphs. Therefore, Cypher queries represent patterns of nodes and the connections between them. 

A Cypher query, like the one below, is composed of several parts. In this section, we will go through several of the most commonly used parts and explain what they do in the context of a Cypher query. Some of these will be explained in more detail in later sections. 

<code>MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT 25</code>
