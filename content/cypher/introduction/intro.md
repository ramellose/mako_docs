Neo4j databases can be accessed through Cypher queries. The range of possibilities with the Cypher query language is huge and this manual is not intended to be an exhaustive reference; rather, we will explain how data schemas help write Cypher queries, what the data schema used by mako looks like and show several queries that can be used to query a database generated by mako. 

For a quick introduction on Cypher syntax, please take a look at <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/current/cypher-intro/">Neo4j's Introduction to Cypher</a>. Neo4j also has written an exhaustive Cypher manual which you can find <a href="<a href="https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/">here, in the developer guides</a>.
