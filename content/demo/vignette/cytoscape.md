Instead of working with the Neo4j database directly, it is also possible to export a specific network to a graphml file or to a running Cytoscape instance with the commands below. Specify the target network with the <code>-net</code> flag. The new network is exported to the specified file path in <code>-fp</code>. The <code>-cyto</code> flag is used to tell mako to export the network to Cytoscape as well.

<code>mako io -fp local_filepath -cf -net Genus_demo_1 -cyto -w</code>
