Before we can upload any data to Neo4j, we first need to create the appropriate files to upload. 
Specifically, we need the following files: tab-delimited taxon abundance and lineage files, and an edge list that links microbes to metabolites. We will use the R package <a href="https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/">phyloseq</a> to generate the first file and use <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmisc/Hmisc.pdf">Hmisc</a> to generate the correlations. 

In an R environment, let's first load the necessary packages and files. Make sure your working directory is set to the location where you downloaded the files. 

If you have not yet installed Hmisc, use <code>```install.packages("Hmisc")```</code> to install it. Please set the input and output filepaths to the locations where you stored your files. 

<pre><code>
library(Hmisc)

input <- "C:/Users/username/Input"
output <- "C:/Users/username/Output"

ibd_lineages <- read.csv(file.path(input, "ibd_lineages.csv"), row.names="X")
metabolite_features <- read.csv(file.path(input, "ibd_metabolite_features.csv"), row.names="X")
metabolite_abundances <- read.csv(file.path(input, "ibd_metabolite_abundances.csv"), row.names="X")
ibd_metadata <- read.csv(file.path(input, "ibd_metadata.csv"), row.names="X")
ibd_taxa <- read.csv(file.path(input, "ibd_taxa.csv"), row.names="X")
</pre></code>

We will remove healthy control samples from this file, since we are only interested in microbe-metabolite associations that occur in people with IBD. 

<pre><code>
ibd_samples <- row.names(ibd_metadata[ibd_metadata$Diagnosis!="Control",])
ibd_taxa <- ibd_taxa[,colnames(ibd_taxa) %in% ibd_samples]
metabolite_abundances <- metabolite_abundances[,colnames(metabolite_abundances) %in% ibd_samples]
</pre></code>

Next, let's calculate correlations between the relative abundances and the metabolites. We will use the <code>rcorr</code> function to do this. Since the function calculates all intra-matrix correlations as well, we need to 
do some additional processing to use the results. 
First, we will flatten the matrices to make a data frame that contains taxa, metabolites and the strength of the correlation. For missing Spearman correlations, this causes a missing value that we later need to remove.  
The <code>rcorr</code> function calculates all microbe-microbe and metabolite-metabolite correlations as well. Therefore, the next step is to filter these correlations; any correlation where the first position is present in the <code>metabolite_abundances</code> dataframe will be removed, while we can do the same for correlations where the second position is present in the <code>ibd_taxa</code> dataframe. We will only apply multiple-testing correction after all these irrelevant correlations are removed, so we are not correcting for tests that we only did out of convenience. 
Since there are so many potential associations, we will correct for multiple testing and only use the remaining correlations. 

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The rcorr function can take a long time to run." >}}

<pre><code>
results <- rcorr(t(ibd_taxa), t(metabolite_abundances), type="spearman")

upper <- upper.tri(results$r)
corr_data <- data.frame(Taxon=rownames(results$r)[row(results$r)][upper], 
                        Metabolite=rownames(results$r)[col(results$r)[upper]], 
                        weight=(results$r)[upper], 
                        p = results$P[upper])

corr_data <- corr_data[!is.na(corr_data$p),]
corr_data <- corr_data[corr_data$Taxon %in% rownames(ibd_taxa),]
corr_data <- corr_data[corr_data$Metabolite %in% rownames(metabolite_abundances),]

corr_data$p <- p.adjust(corr_data$p, method="bonferroni")
corr_data <- corr_data[corr_data$p <= 0.05,]
corr_data$p <- NULL
</pre></code>

At over 7000 significant correlations remaining, this still leaves us with a large number of microbe-metabolite correlations to interpret. We will therefore include metabolite features in the Neo4j database so we can use this to make more informative analyses. Finally, we will export all other required files in formats that can be used by mako. The default <code>write.table</code> function does not export the row name header in a format that the Python BIOM implementation can work with, so we will adapt this call to prevent any bugs. The same goes for the edge lists, which should not include row numbers. Moreover, we want to remove any quotes in the file, because those will be uploaded to Neo4j as well. Finally, keep in mind that column names should not contain characters that cannot be used as Neo4j node labels, like a period. 

<pre><code>
chemclass <- data.frame(Metabolite=rownames(metabolite_features), Chemical_class=metabolite_features$Chemical.class)
chemclass <- chemclass[!is.na(chemclass$Chemical_class),]
standardmatch <- data.frame(Metabolite=rownames(metabolite_features), Standard_match=metabolite_features$Standard.match)
standardmatch <- standardmatch[!is.na(standardmatch$Standard_match),]

write.table(corr_data, file.path(output, "microbe_metabolite.tsv"), sep="\t", row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
write.table(data.frame("Species"=rownames(ibd_taxa), ibd_taxa), file.path(output, "ibd_taxa.tsv"), sep="\t", row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
write.table(data.frame("Species"=rownames(ibd_lineages), ibd_lineages), file.path(output, "ibd_lineages.tsv"), sep="\t", row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
write.table(chemclass, file.path(output, "chemclass.tsv"), sep="\t", row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
write.table(standardmatch, file.path(output, "standardmatch.tsv"), sep="\t", row.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
