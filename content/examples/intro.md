The mako software can be used to integrate multiple sources of data and write them to Neo4j databases, according to a pre-defined database schema. The case studies below have been selected to demonstrate the simplicity and speed with which mako is able to process microbiome data. In brief, the case studies address the following topics:<br>

<ul>
  <li>Rapid meta-analysis of multiple sponge-specific networks</li>
  <li>Creating and querying hierarchical metabolic data</li>
  <li>Validating an association network using microbe-metabolite interactions mined from literature</li>
  <li>Working with a curated data set containing 60 unique studies</li>
  <li>Querying 3- and 4-node cliques</li>
  <li>Identifying associations linked to a metabolic pathway</li>
</ul>
