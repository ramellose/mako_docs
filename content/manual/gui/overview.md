The GUI provides a graphical interface for most of the functionality of the CLI. 
There are two ways to run the GUI: you can download and run the executable, or you can run the GUI script. 
You can download the executables from <a href="https://github.com/ramellose/mako/releases">the mako releases page</a>. Releases that come with updated executables, have them listed in the release description. 

Alternatively, you can run the <code>main_GUI.py</code> script from a Python IDE. Simply download the mako git repository, install all dependencies and use your IDE to start <a href="https://github.com/ramellose/mako/tree/master/mako"><code>main_GUI.py</code></a>. This takes a little more work to set up, but ensures that your GUI is running the latest version of mako. 

The GUI commands largely follow the same structure as the CLI, meaning most CLI parameters are shown in the GUI and have a tooltip explaining the parameter choice.
