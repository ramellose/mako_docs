The database schema used by mako defines a set structure for uploading microbiome-related files to a Neo4j database. The software tool is based around this data schema and provides an application programming interface (API), command line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI) for converting files to the database, or for extracting relevant files and exporting these as a text file or to Cytoscape. 

In this manual, we will briefly discuss mako's CLI, GUI and API. Each of the commands of the CLI will be discussed in detail. For the API, we will address the structure of the drivers and key commands that can be used to run custom Python scripts.
