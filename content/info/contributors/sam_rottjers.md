Sam Röttjers is a PhD student of Karoline and works on method development for noisy networks. Sam focuses on the top-down side of microbiome research and has worked with data from arthropod endosymbionts, the human gut and ocean time series. His main goal is to translate concepts from theoretical ecology and network theory to association networks in a way that deals with the inherently low accuracy of these networks.
