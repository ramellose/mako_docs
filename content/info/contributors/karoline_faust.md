Prof. Karoline Faust heads the Lab of Microbial Systems Biology at KU Leuven. Karoline has worked extensively on microbiomes from all over the planet and has developed several methods for microbiome analysis. Her lab analyses microbiome data across several levels of complexity, ranging from world-wide ocean communities to highly controlled communities in laboratory fermentors. Her ultimate goal is to build models of microbial communities that can be used to manipulate these communities. Karoline has extensive experience with metabolic networks and association networks and is currently applying this knowledge to <i>in vitro</i> microbial communities.
